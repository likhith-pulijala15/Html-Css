      <u>One of the highest-grossing actors of all time</u>, his films as a
      leading actor have grossed over $14 billion worldwide. In 2008, Downey was

      <strong>Emmy Award</strong>, three <strong>Golden Globe Awards</strong>,

    <p>
      Downey received acclaim for his role in <b>Christopher Nolan</b>'s
      <b>Oppenheimer</b> (2023), winning an <b>Academy Award</b>, a
      <b>Golden Globe</b>, and a <b>BAFTA Award</b> for Best Supporting Actor

    <h2>Career</h2>

    <p>
      <big><b>1983–1995: Early work and critical acclaim</b></big>
    </p>
    <p>
      That same year, Downey had a dramatic acting breakthrough when he played
      <b>James Spader</b>'s sidekick in <em><b>Tuff Turf</b></em> and then a
      bully in <b>John Hughes</b>'s Weird Science. Molly Ringwald wanted him for
      the role of Duckie in John Hughes's 1986 film
      <em><b>Pretty in Pink</b></em
      >, but the part went to Jon Cryer. He went on to star with Ringwald in his
      first lead role in The Pick-up Artist (1987). Because of these and other
      coming-of-age films Downey did during the 1980s, he is sometimes named as
      a member of the Brat Pack. Downey moved to Hollywood and lived with fellow
      actors <strong>Billy Zane</strong>, who later appeared with Downey in
      <em><b>Only You</b></em> (1994); Sarah Jessica Parker; and Kiefer
      Sutherland, who starred with Downey in <i><b>1969</b></i> (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1992, he starred as <b>Charlie Chaplin</b> in <i><b>Chaplin</b></i
      >, a role for which he prepared extensively, learning how to play the
      violin as well as tennis left-handed. He had a personal coach in order to
      help him imitate Chaplin's posture and way of carrying himself.<sup
        ><b>[40]</b></sup
      >
      The role garnered Downey an <b>Academy Award</b> nomination for Best Actor
      at the <b>65th Academy Awards ceremony</b>, losing to Al Pacino in
      <em><b>Scent of a Woman</b></em
      >.<sup><b>[41]</b></sup> In 1993, he appeared in the films
      <b>Heart and Souls</b> with Alfre Woodard and Kyra Sedgwick and
      <b>Short Cuts</b> with Matthew Modine and Julianne Moore, along with a
      documentary that he wrote about the 1992 presidential campaigns titled
      <b>The Last Party</b> (1993).<sup><b>[42][43][44]</b></sup> He starred in
      the 1994 films <b>Only You</b> with Marisa Tomei, and
      <b>Natural Born Killers</b>, with Woody Harrelson.<sup
        ><b>[45][46]</b></sup
      >
      He then subsequently appeared in <b>Restoration</b> (1995),
      <b>Richard III</b> (1995), <b>Home for the Holidays</b> (1995),
      <b>Two Girls and a Guy</b> (1997),<sup><b>[47]</b></sup> as Special Agent
      John Royce in U.S. Marshals (1998), and in Black and White (1999).<sup
        ><b>[48][49][50][51]</b></sup

    </p>
    <br />
    <big><b>1996-2001: Addiction-related setbacks and Ally McBeal</b></big>
    <p>
      From 1996 through 2001, Downey was arrested several times on charges
      related to drugs, including <strong>cocaine</strong>,
      <strong>heroin</strong>, and marijuana.<sup><b>[52]</b></sup> He went
      through drug treatment programs and spent time in county jail and prison.
      He explained in 1999 to a judge: "It's like I have a shotgun in my mouth,
      and I've got my finger on the trigger, and I like the taste of the gun
      metal." He said he had been addicted to drugs since the age of eight due
      to the fact that his father had been giving them to him.<sup
        ><b>[53]</b></sup
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      In early 1996, after becoming increasingly concerned for Downey,
      <strong>Sean Penn</strong> and <strong>Dennis Quaid</strong> knocked on
      his door, took his keys, and took him to a rehab center in <b>Tucson</b>;
      however, Downey escaped and checked himself out a few days later.<sup
        ><b>[35]</b></sup
      >
      In June 1996, Downey was arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, crack
      cocaine, and an unloaded .357 Magnum handgun while he was speeding down
      Sunset Boulevard. A month later, while on parole, he wandered into a
      neighbor's home through the unlocked front door while under the influence
      of a controlled substance and fell asleep in one of the beds.<sup
        ><b>[54][55]</b></sup
      >
      The family refused to press trespassing charges.<sup><b>[36]</b></sup> The
      tape of the neighbor's 911 call was made available online, and it became
      known as the "Goldilocks incident".<sup><b>[56]</b></sup> In November
      1996, after spending time in court-ordered rehab, he received a further
      six months of live-in rehab, three years' probation, and was ordered to
      undergo compulsory drug testing.<sup><b>[36]</b></sup> In 1997, he missed
      one of the court-ordered drug tests and had to spend six months in the Los
      Angeles County jail.<sup><b>[57]</b></sup> After being released, he went
      into a court-ordered 120-day rehab program.<sup><b>[36]</b></sup>

    <big><b>2008-2019: Stardom with Iron Man</b></big>
    <p>
      Despite all of the critical success Downey had experienced throughout his
      career, he had not appeared in a <b>"blockbuster" film</b>. That changed
      in 2008, when Downey starred in two critically and commercially successful
      films, <em><b>Iron Man</b></em> and <em><b>Tropic Thunder</b></em
      >. In the article <b>Ben Stiller</b> wrote for Downey's entry in the 2008
      edition of <i><b>The Time 100</b></i
      >, he offered an observation on Downey's commercially successful summer at
      the box office: Yes, Downey is <i>Iron Man</i>, but he really is Actor Man
      ... In the realm where box office is irrelevant and talent is king, the
      realm that actually means something, he has always ruled, and finally this
      summer he gets to have his cake and let us eat him up all the way to the
      multiplex, where his mastery is in full effect.

    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <hr />
    <big><b>Relationship and marriages</b></big>
    <p>
      Downey started dating actress <b>Sarah Jessica Parker</b> in 1984 after
      meeting her on the set of <em><b>Firstborn</b></em
      >. They were both 18 and moved in together after eight weeks of
      dating.<sup><b>[25]</b></sup> The couple separated eight years later, in
      1991, due to his <b>drug addiction</b>.<sup><b>[144]</b></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Downey married actress and singer <b>Deborah Falconer</b> on May 29, 1992,
      after a 42-day courtship.<sup><b>[145]</b></sup> They had only known each
      other for six weeks before marrying.<sup><b>[146]</b></sup> Their son was
      born in September 1993.<sup><b>[147]</b></sup> The strain on their
      marriage from Downey's repeated trips to rehab and jail finally reached a
      breaking point; in 1996, Falconer left Downey and filed for divorce in
      early 2001, citing "<b>irreconcilable differences</b>" as the reason.<sup
        ><b>[148]</b></sup
      >
      Downey and Falconer finalized their divorce in 2004, with Falconer gaining
      custody of their son.<sup><b>[149]</b></sup>
